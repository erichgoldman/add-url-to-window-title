language = American English
showFullURL_title = Show the full URL?
showFullURL_description = Checked shows the full URL; Unchecked shows only the hostname

urlFormat_title = URL Format
urlFormat_description = Full URL format: {protocol}://{hostname}{port}/{path}{args}{hash}

separatorString_title = Separator String
separatorString_description = A string to be put between the original title and the URL (e.g., 'Title - URL' or 'Title :: URL')

showFieldAttributes_title = Show the field attributes when a text input field has focus?
showFieldAttributes_description = When this is checked, the 'name' and 'id' attributes of <input /> fields will be added to the title when they have focus. This is useful if you have a page where the URL is not enough for Keepass to determine the proper auto-type. This is good for two-step logons as well. You simply create an auto-type command specific to the field, now you can determine the auto-type based on the URL and the specific field you are in.
